# PersonalScripts

Hello There! If you're name isn't William Winslade, I'm honestly suprised that you've found your way here!

I hope you're doing well whomever you are; This readme file will serve as a brief summary of projects and concepts that I've built and used in this repository for my own personal coding edification.

# Projects:
- executeAFINES.py
   - As part of working with Dr. Abel in UTK's CBE department for undergraduate research, I was tasked with running computer simulations of actin filament networks for purposes of analyzing the forces between the actin polymers as a result of several conditions. In order to efficiently execute these simulations, of which I would need to run up to 50 in one sitting, I wrote this python script to take a range of variable values that I pre-determined, and run the AFINES simualtion executable with these values accordingly.

# Concepts used:
- Basic syntax and flow control
- Reading data from files
- Calling other executables from a python script
- User interface/feedback
